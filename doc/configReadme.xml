As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize Opportunities between two Salesforce orgs.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating Opportunities from one Salesforce instance to another, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behaviour when an Opportunity already exists in the destination org. 

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in  Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the SalesForce Org A and query all the existing Opportunities that match the filter criteria.
The last step of the Process stage will group the Opportunities and create them in SFDC Org B.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In any of the ways you would like to run this Anypoint Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>
<b>Records to Be Processed: </b>9<br/>
<b>Start execution on: </b>Mon Aug 17 18:05:33 GMT-03:00 2015
</pre>

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcOpportunitymigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcOpportunitymigration.cloudhub.io/migrateopportunities` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

<![CDATA[
After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migrateopportunities` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

#### Account Sync Policy

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the three following values: 

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the opportunity over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the opportunity's account if this is not pressent in the Salesforce instance B.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Opportunities to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Opportunities are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

$H$H#  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateOpportunities` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Opportunities synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
